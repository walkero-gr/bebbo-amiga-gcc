The GNU C-Compiler with Binutils and other useful tools for cross development

This is a Makefile based approach to build the same files as in the old amigaos-toolchain to reduce the build time.

Right now these tools are build:
* binutils
* gcc with libs for C/C++/ObjC
* fd2sfd
* fd2pragma
* ira
* sfdc
* vbcc
* vlink
* libnix
* ixemul (not really, but the headers are used)

There are also libraries - calles SDK - which can be downloaded and installed plus libraries that are built from source. All of these provide their own copyrights - too long to list here.

To get it work together and enhance it, some patches are applied here and there and the gcc compiler contains a tad more hacks/enhancements.
None if these changese modifies the original copyright in any way. All other stuff here is published using the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V2.

# Short Guide
## Prerequisites
### Centos
`sudo yum install wget gcc gcc-c++ python git perl-Pod-Simple gperf patch autoconf automake make makedepend bison flex ncurses-devel gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel gettext-devel texinfo rsync readline-devel`

### Fedora
`sudo dnf install wget gcc gcc-c++ python git perl-Pod-Simple gperf patch autoconf automake make makedepend bison flex ncurses-devel gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel gettext-devel texinfo rsync readline-devel`

### Ubuntu, Debian
`sudo apt install make wget git gcc g++ lhasa libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev flex bison gettext texinfo ncurses-dev autoconf rsync libreadline-dev`

If building with a normal user, the `PREFIX` directory must be writable (default is `/opt/amiga`). You can add the user to an appropriate group. 

### macOS
Install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) or any other package manager first. The compiler will be installed together with XCode. Once XCode and Homebrew are up install the required packages:

```
brew install bash wget make lhasa gmp mpfr libmpc flex gettext gnu-sed texinfo gcc@12 make autoconf bison
```

By default macOS uses an outdated version of bash. Therefore, on macOS host always pass the the SHELL=/usr/local/bin/bash parameter (or any other valid path pointing to bash), e.g.:

```
make all SHELL=$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
```

On macOS it may be also necessary to point to the brew version of gcc make and autoconf, e.g.:

```
CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 gmake all SHELL=$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
```

**NOTE**

* You might need to use the brew version of make when building your projects (e.g.: `gmake`). Link failures are known to happen with GNU Make 3.81, but to succeed with GNU Make 4.4.1 on the same machine and project
* If you want `m68k-amigaos-gdb` then you have to build it with `gcc`
* The `gdb` build also needs a more recent `bison` version than the one installed
  in macOS. Use the version from Homebrew instead. It's keg only so you need
  to add it to your `PATH` manually:

```
export PATH=$(brew --prefix bison)/bin:$PATH
```

### macOS on M1
Native builds on M1 Macs are now directly supported.

### Windows with Cygwin
Install cygwin via setup.exe and add wget. Then open cygwin shell and run:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
apt-cyg install gcc-core gcc-g++ python git perl-Pod-Simple gperf patch automake make makedepend bison flex libncurses-devel python-devel gettext-devel libgmp-devel libmpc-devel libmpfr-devel rsync
```

### Windows with msys2

Precompiled suite with installer: http://franke.ms/download/setup-amiga-gcc.exe

```
pacman -S git base-devel gcc flex gmp-devel mpc-devel mpfr-devel ncurses-devel rsync autoconf automake
```

Also note that you **MUST** cd into an **absolute path** e.g. `cd /c/msys64/home/test/amiga-gcc/` before running make, or builds may fail, because some files aren't found correctly (that's a msys2 bug).

### Ubuntu running on the Windows 10 Linux subsystem
same as normal ubuntu

## Howto Clone and Download All You Need
```
git clone https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc
cd amiga-gcc
make update
```

## Overview
```
make help
```
yields:
```
make help 		        display this help
make all 		          build and install all
make <target>		      builds a target: binutils, gcc, fd2sfd, fd2pragma, ira, sfdc, vbcc, vlink, libnix, ixemul, libgcc
make clean		        remove the build folder
make clean-<target>	  remove the target's build folder
make drop-prefix	    remove all content from the prefix folder, beware!
make update		        perform git pull for all targets
make update-<target>	perform git pull for the given target
```
display which targets can be build, you'll mostly use
*`make all`
*`make clean`
*`make drop-prefix`

to use NDK3.2 add `NDK=3.2` to the make parameters

## Prefix
The default prefix is `/opt/amiga`. You may specify a different prefix by adding `PREFIX=yourprefix` to make command. E.g.
```
make all PREFIX=/here/or/there
```
The build performs the installation automatically, there is no separate `make install` step. Because of this, you must make sure that the target `PREFIX` directory is writable for the user who is doing the build.
If the `PREFIX` directory points to a directory where the user already has appropriate permissions the below steps can be ommited and the directory will be created by the build process.
```
sudo mkdir /opt/amiga
sudo chgrp users /opt/amiga
sudo chmod 775 /opt/amiga
sudo usermod -a -G users username
```
After adding the user to the group, you may have to logout and login again to apply the changes to your user.

## Building
Simply run `make all`. Also add -j to speedup the build.

```
make clean
make drop-prefix
time make all -j3
```
takes roughly 10 minutes on my laptop running ubuntu. takes forever running cygwin on windows^^.

## Kickstart 1.3

If you plan to develop for Kickstart 1.3 you should use `-mcrt=nix13` in your compiler commandline

```
m68k-amigaos-gcc test.cpp -mcrt=nix13
```

The include files for 1.3 - which are picked up by the compiler if `-mcrt=nix13` is used - can be found at `<PREFIX>/m68k-amigaos/ndk13-include` i.E. `/opt/amiga/m68k-amigaos/ndk13-include`

## Checking gcc

To check the built version you may consider to run the gcc dejagnu tests. This does not cover everything but it's a start.
The tests are using my improved version of VAMOS (downstream of https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools) to emulate the Amiga,
and right now not all improvements went back into the upstream.

### Debian / Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install dejagnu
sudo cp baseboards/* /usr/share/dejagnu/baseboards
pip install -U git+https://github.com/bebbo/amitools.git  
make check
```

### macOS
```
brew install dejagnu
cp baseboards/* $(brew --prefix)/opt/dejagnu/share/dejagnu/baseboards
pip install -U  git+https://github.com/bebbo/amitools.git  
make check
```

## Version management
This project does not use git submodules since it's to inconvenient to work with develop and release branches in each module and the main module.

Instead the **Makefile** provides some targets to switch to an older state for all modules.

### Switching amiga-gcc to a given date
Use make to switch all modules to a given date. You may also add the time
```
make v date=2021-04-01
```
### Switching amiga-gcc back to the branches
Run make to switch all modules back to the branch
```
make v
```
### Show the current commit for all submodules
This lists all modules with the last commit. Useful if you switched to a given date to show what's where.
```
make l
```
### Switch a module to a different branch
You can switch modules to different branches. E.g.
```
make branch mod=binutils branch=devel1
```
The default branches and repositories are in the file **default-repos**, the local state is managed in the file **.repos**.

Note that the gcc default branch is now `amiga6` and there is also an `amiga10` branch.
